# Sonor

A collaborative effort to liberate Sonos devices from their cloudy masters.

The primary objective of this project is to determine whether it is possible
to recover Sonos devices which have been placed into so-called 'recycling
mode'. If this is not possible due to server side blacklisting of devices
then  this project will instead focus effort of whether 'recycled' hardware
can be repurposed - ideally via software modification.

## Devices

Support / validation against the following devices is currently being worked
on:

1. [Sonos One (Generation 2) [S18]](devices/S18-One/README.md)
2. [Sonos ZP120](devices/ZP120/README.md)

## Collaboration

Please feel free to open issues and pull requests with information collected
during analysis of Sonos devices. Information will be merged into the
respective trees with all credit provided for contributions.

In order to add a new device, please open a pull request with a tree set-out
in the same manner as `devices/S18-One/`.
