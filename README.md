# Sonor

A collaborative effort to liberate Sonos devices from their cloudy masters.

The primary objective of this project is to determine whether it is possible
to recover Sonos devices which have been placed into so-called 'recycling
mode'. If this is not possible due to server side blacklisting of devices
then  this project will instead focus effort of whether 'recycled' hardware
can be repurposed - ideally via software modification.

## Devices
